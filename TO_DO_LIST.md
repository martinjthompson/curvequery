To Do List
----------

The following is a list of new features and improvements planned for the curvequery package module.

### Known Issues
* For 4 Series, 5 Series and 6 Series oscilloscopes, the curve feature raises an exception if there 
    is no data available to download.


### Potential New Features
* Add code to test core framework that does not depend on specific instrument functionality.
* Add a new method to WaveformCollections that will format the data for a Pandas DataFrame.
* Add a new measurement capture feature for 4 Series, 5 Series and 6 Series oscilloscopes.
* Add bus decode table capture feature for 4 Series, 5 Series and 6 Series oscilloscopes.
* Capturing REF waveforms from 4 Series, 5 Series and 6 Series oscilloscopes.
* Capturing analog waveforms as 8-bit or 16-bit integers on 4 Series, 5 Series and 6 Series 
    instruments.
